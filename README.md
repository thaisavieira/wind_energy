# Data Analysis of a Wind Turbine

This data analysis project was made using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a Python distribution for scientific computing, with the goal of:
- Enhance Python DSA abilities, in particular lists, variables, functions, and loops;
- Introduction to data visualization;
- Improve Jupyter notebook skills and basic knowledge of libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas;
- Review basic statistics concepts;

In this project a public dataset from Kaggle's website is used, ["Wind Turbine Scada Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset), where is possible to find data/time (for 10 minutes intervals), power (the power generated by the turbine for that moment), wind speed, theoretical power, and wind direction.  With the data provided, analyses were made with the real/active power and theoretical power visually. For real power, data was processed for cases above and below the theoretical curve and the zero point.
